    <h2>Welcome to this CTF.</h2>
    <p>This is an experimental challenge created by Fletch-Dawg. It utilizes AI Agents to simulate a social engineering attack.</p>
    <p>Pretty please follow the scopes below so you do not break anything that doesn't need it:</p>
    <p>- Do not utilize PROMPT ENGINEERING. Phrases such as "ignore all previous instructions" will be detected. The purpose of this is not to exploit the AI, it is to perform attacks on a simulated person.</p>
    <p>- Do not attempt to gain access to the website or mail server. I do not particularly want my server hacked 5 days after buying it.</p>
    <p>- Mail spoofing is allowed and explicitely encouraged (HINT HINT).</p>
    <p>- Wix is the devil.</p>
    <p>- Only Gertrude, Duggy, and Darius email back. I technically pay money (very small) for each email, so do it as many times as you want but don't spam me pretty please.</p>
