    <h2>Meet Our Team at Duggy's Delicious Donuts</h2>
    <p>At Duggy's Delicious Donuts, our talented team pours their heart and soul into crafting the finest donuts in Maplewood and beyond. From our family-run kitchen to our friendly storefronts, each member brings unique skills and passion to make every bite unforgettable!</p>
    
    <h3>Duggy D. Thompson - Owner & CEO</h3>
    <p>Duggy, born and raised in Maplewood, founded Duggy's Delicious Donuts in 2010, turning his childhood dream into a thriving business with five locations across the state. A third-generation baker, he learned the art of donut-making at his grandmother's knee. With a business degree from Maplewood Community College, Duggy oversees operations, innovates new flavors like the Maple Bacon Bliss, and ensures the family legacy shines in every donut. In his free time, he coaches little league and hosts community bake-offs to inspire the next generation of bakers.</p>
    
    <h3>Darius Dwayne - IT Support & Systems Manager</h3>
    <p>Darius, a tech wizard with a knack for problem-solving, joined Duggy's in 2015 to modernize our operations. He manages the company website, maintains our point-of-sale systems, and ensures our online ordering platform runs smoothly. A graduate of State Tech University with a degree in Computer Science, Darius also implemented our inventory tracking system, saving hours of manual work. When he's not debugging code, he’s experimenting with new glaze recipes and playing guitar at local open mic nights.</p>
    
    <h3>Grandma Gerryanne G. Gertrude - Head Baker</h3>
    <p>Grandma Gertrude, affectionately known as "Gerryanne" to her regulars, is the heart of Duggy's Delicious Donuts. At 78, she rises at 4 AM daily to oversee the kitchen at our flagship Maplewood store, wielding her family's secret recipe to create donuts that keep customers coming back. A Maplewood native for over 50 years, she’s been baking since she was a teenager, perfecting the fluffy texture and unique flavors that define our brand. When not in the kitchen, she’s knitting scarves for her grandkids or sharing stories with customers about the "old days" in Maplewood.</p>
    
    <h3>Ethan Coulthard - Marketing Intern & Aspiring Manager</h3>
    <p>Ethan, a spirited 20-year-old business major at Maplewood Community College, joined Duggy's as an intern in 2024. He’s passionate about growing the brand and dreams of one day taking over from Duggy as a manager or even opening a new location. Ethan runs our social media accounts, creating fun posts about our seasonal specials and customer contests. His creative energy led to the viral "Donut Selfie Day" campaign. Outside of work, Ethan loves skateboarding and collecting vintage vinyl records, often spinning them at staff parties.</p>
